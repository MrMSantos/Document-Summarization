		BERLIN — When North Korea tested a new kind of intercontinental ballistic missile on Wednesday, Pyongyang boasted that the regime could now strike “anywhere in the mainland United States.” Experts have calculated that the missile could theoretically reach Washington D.C. which is about 6,700 miles away from North Korea. Less noticed, however, is the fact that North Korea’s recent tests have also [&#8230;]]]></description>
